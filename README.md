Shop Local 🛒
=======================
## What this project was created for 🏪
This is a project that I created on my own for submission to SWE Hacks '22 hosted by UW SWE. The overall theme was to create a project based on the idea that working together is how progress is actually made. Their tracks are focused on issues that have arisen due to the pandemic.  
## Inspiration 💡
Covid restrictions around the world are finally being eased back enough that people are trying to resume the lives that they had before Covid. A major change though is that while the people moved towards doing many things virtually, local businesses changed to accommodate these changes. Many people who try to go to their favorite shops now have to adjust and figure out which of the shops are still in business, their new business hours, etc. This site is meant to bridge the information gap between operating businesses and their local community and put it all into one database.
##  What this does 🗃️
Businesses are able to create a page for their shop and post updates if anything changes.  
Customers only have the ability to search up businesses and view their pages.
## How it was built 🔧
I first designed the site on Figma then worked on recreating it with HTML and CSS.
## Challenges ⛰️
I had some difficulty managing my time as I was also dealing with midterm deadlines.
## What was learned 🧠
I learned how to be make the components in Figma more interactive and creating a search bar that users can actually type into.
